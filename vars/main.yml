# vars file for ansible-rook

# This variable defines a list of storage pools that will be created
# The expected format for the content of this variable is a list:
# ceph_block_storage_pools:
#   - pool_name: pool_name
#     pool_replicas: 2

# This variable defines a list of storage clases that will be created on the k8s cluster
# The expected format can be found below:
# rook_storage_classes:
#   - name: class_name
#     blockPoolName: pool_name
#     storageClassProvisioner: rook-ceph.rbd.csi.ceph.com
#   - name: rook-storage-class-filesystem
#     fileSystemName: myFS
#     storageClassProvisioner: rook-ceph.cephfs.csi.ceph.com

## This defines a list of shared ceph filesystems (do not use underscores in name)
# ceph_file_systems:
#   - name: ceph-filesystem-name
#     ## use either pool_replicas...
#     pool_replicas:
#       metadata: 3
#       data: 3
#     ## ... or erasureCoded
#     erasureCoded:
#       dataChunks: 2
#       codingChunks: 1
#     metadata_active: 1

## [Optional] deploy ceph-mount to mount this filesystem on the host as well
# rook_mount_on_host:
# - name: mount-repl-shared-fs
#   storageClassName: rook-ceph-filesystem-class
#   enabled: true
#   ## Optional for the ceph-mount pods, that mount this whole filesystem on the host
#   hostPath: /mnt
