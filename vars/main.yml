# Sample vars file for ansible-rook

## Configurations related to Ceph rbd (Block Storage)
## A device will be skipped if Rook detects an existing partition or a filesystem.
# rook_osd_device_filter: "raw_device_name"
# rook_storage_config:
#   ## Comment "metadataDevice" If you don't have a separate device for metadata
#   metadataDevice: "sdb"
#   databaseSizeMB: "1024"
#   journalSizeMB: "1024"

## Ceph Block Device configuration (You can use CephFS and Ceph Block Device in the same storage cluster)
# ceph_block_pools:
# - name: erasurecoded-data-pool
#   erasureCoded:
#     dataChunks: 2
#     codingChunks: 1
# - name: replicated-metadata-pool
#   replicated:
#     size: 3

## Alternatively to storage pool, a Cheph filesystems can be defined:
## See filesystem.yaml.j2 for allowed fields and spec
#ceph_file_systems:
#- name: ceph_filesystem_name
#  metadataPool:
#    replicated:
#      size: 2
#  dataPools:
#  - replicated:
#      size: 3
#  ## Alternatively or in addition to, erasurecoded pool may be used
#  - erasureCoded:
#      dataChunks: 2
#      codingChunks: 1

## Optionally, define storage classses
## storageClassProvisioner should use CSI driver in favor of Flex driver (https://github.com/rook/rook/blob/master/Documentation/ceph-filesystem.md#provision-storage)
